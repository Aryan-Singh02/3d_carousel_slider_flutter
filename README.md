## 📐 Architecture

The app is built using the following Flutter components:

- `PageView.builder` — to handle swipe-based page scrolling.
- `Transform` and `Matrix4` — to apply 3D rotation and perspective.
- `AnimationController` and `AnimatedBuilder` — for tap animations.
- `MediaQuery` — to make the UI responsive for tablets and mobile screens.

State management is handled using Flutter's native `StatefulWidget` and `setState()`.
